The cartilage is a highly pressurized tissue, in which chondrocytes metabolically secrete highly charged proteoglycans that create swelling pressure in a dense and rigid collagen scaffold. The pressurization is further exacerbated by load-bearing duties which pressurize the interstitial fluids of the cartilage. As a postdoc in the Chaudhuri lab at Stanford, I am investigating how this pressurized environment influences cellular function in chondrocytes. To do this, I am studying chondrocyte behavior in 3-D in vitro models of the articular cartilage, consisting of chondrocytes embedded in engineered hydrogels of tunable viscoelasticity, which differentially gate metabolically-secreted proteins to create different pressurized environments for the chondrocytes. I am also studying how these cellular responses are amplified by external mechanical loads. These questions are expected to probe fundamental processes underlying the development and maturation of cartilage in mammalian species.
